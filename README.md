# Logbook

A sailing logbook featuring

- GPX files for showing tracks on Openlayers map
- OpenSeaMap overlay

The application is based on ES6 without using any framework.

Th source files are loaded directly by the browser, so there is no build, no packaging no nothing :)

## TODO

- Analysis of tracks using Google Charts
- Historical weather data
